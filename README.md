# MQTTBasedProject
RTP 2 Project with RPI and ESP32.
In the Internet of Things domain, data is sent from sensors or devices over a network.
 On the other side of the network, it is upto web based applications to monitor or visualize this data.
 One can do a small project simulating the sensor data, but then building a web based application that is displaying the sensor data in a browser (on a chart ) in real time.
 As data changes on the sensor, you should be able to see the chart updated in real time.
 One can do this using an MQTT server in between the sensor and the web application.
 The Web app could be ReactJS, AngularJS or something similar using Charts like ChartJS.
